First off the images used in this assignment are credited to the great artist Dr. Samuel himself. I was not brave enough to attempt to show off my lack of artistic skills. 
Next for this assignment I created a component called AttributeAdder.js which is a reusable component that displays the users current specified skill points and the option to either increase or decrease their points.
To handle data sharing between pages on my application, I placed all of my views into HW2.js in which I controlled the displayed view based on the current game state. I had 5 different states for my game: STAT_SCREEN_STATE, COMBAT_SCREEN_STATE, WON_GAME, LOSE_GAME, and START_GAME. These game states were mainly based off of the user's health points or monster's health points. For example if the player's health points are 0 then the player loses and the game stat is set to LOSE_GAME and the view for that state is displayed. Or if the monster's health points are 0 then the player wins and the game state is set to WIN_GAME and the view for that state is displayed.
To handle the state of the player's/monster's stats, I placed all of that into a reducer hook. And the logic for updating the state was in a switch statement that error checked the data and updated accordingly.
